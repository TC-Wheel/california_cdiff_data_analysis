Field,Format,Definition
Year,Number,Calendar year clostridium difficile infection (CDI) reported 
State,Plain Text,California
HAI,Plain Text,Healthcare-associated infection (HAI): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)
Facility_ID1,Plain Text,"Facility ID. The primary key used to track facility information for all facilities stored in the Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) for California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Center of Healthcare Quality, Licensing and Certification Program.
FACID fields can be used to link to the Healthcare Facility Locations data table to get locations of the facilities."
Facility_Name1,Plain Text,"Facility name for California general acute care hospitals (GACHs), other than long-term acute care (LTAC) and rehabilitation acute care (REHAB) hospitals, reporting  to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), regarding hospital onset (HO) CDI standardized infection ratios (SIR), in a calendar year. All hospitals reported 12 months of data except for hospitals with extreme outlier community-onset C. difficile prevalence rate(s)."
County,Plain Text,"The name of the California county where the facility is located, derived from COUNTY_CODE in the FACILITY table in ELMS, obtained from the facility's license application form."
Hospital_Onset_Cases,Number,"Count of hospital onset (HO) CDIs based on a stool specimen collected more than three days after admission to the facility (i.e., on or after day 4), excluding IRFs and IPFs with their own CCN numbers, and neonatal intensive care units and well-baby nurseries. The ""NHSN Patient Safety Component Manual"" document contains the specific criteria for an HAI such as CDI, and provides examples of how to apply the HAI definition; See the NHSN website: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn. "
Predicted_Cases,Number,"The predicted (expected) number of HO CDI cases  based on the national baseline data, adjusting for the significant risk factors such as CDI test type, community onset admission prevalence rate, facility bed size, and medical school affiliation.  See the NHSN website: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn. "
Patient_Days,Number,"A count of the number of patients in the hospital during a time period, excluding IRFs and IPFs with their own CCN numbers, and neonatal intensive care units and well-baby nurseries. To calculate patient days, for each day of the month, at the same time each day, the number of patients is recorded. At the end of the month, the daily counts are summed.  See the NHSN website: http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn."
SIR,Number,"NHSN standardized infection ratio (SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs over time. It compares the number of reported HAIs to the number of predicted (expected) number of HAIs, based on national baseline data. The SIR also adjusts for several factors that may impact the risk of acquiring an HAI. Specifically, SIR is the ratio of reported HO cases to the NHSN-predicted number of HO cases, adjusted for significant risk factors such as  the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN. An SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. NOTE: See the Newsletter at the NHSN website: www.cdc.gov/nhsn/PDFs/Newsletters/NHSN_NL_OCT_2010SE_final.pdf."
SIR_CI_95_Lower_Limit,Number,"Lower limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval. Calculated using exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation. NOTE:  If the 95% CI for the SIR includes 1, the number of reported cases is not statistically different from that predicted."
SIR_CI_95_Upper_Limit,Number,"Upper limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval. Calculated using exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation. NOTE:  If the 95% CI for the SIR includes 1, the number of reported cases is not statistically different from that predicted."
Comparison,Plain Text,"This field shows if the 95% CI indicates an infection count significantly higher ('Higher'), lower ('Lower') or no different ('No Difference') than predicted."
Notes,Plain Text," A hospital labeled ""Incomplete Reporter"" is a hospital that reported less than 12 months of complete data, and so no SIR was calculated. ¥ SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. ¶ Hospitals with data presented for only 6 or  9 months of the year; data from hospitals that reported extreme outlier community-onset C. difficile prevalence rate for certain quarters of the year were excluded from further analyses for those quarters. * If you don’t see your hospital in the table, your hospital may be reporting data combined with another hospital.  A list of hospitals reporting combined data can be found at: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2015-HAI-Combined-Campuses-CA-Hospitals.pdf.
